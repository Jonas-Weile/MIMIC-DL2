# MIMIC-DL2

This project uses the [DL2 framework](https://github.com/eth-sri/dl2) to create logical constraints for the in-hospital-mortality benchmark dataset for the [MIMIC-III Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/), see [Multitask learning and benchmarking with clinical time series data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771).

## Installation
